		<h2>As a Software Engineer</h2>

			My work experiences include the Visual Studio C++ Developer Experience team, the Direct3D HLSL Compiler team,
			the Windows Composition and Rendering team, and gameplay and tools programming in the video game industry.
			I have been programming since age 10 and graduated in 2014 with a BSc in Computer Science with honours at McGill University.
