		<h2>As a Software Engineer</h2>
		<p>
			I focus on tools and systems programming: graphics, shaders, GPGPU, security, compilers, file formats,
			object-oriented and API design.
			Modern C++ and C# are my go-to languages.
			My work experiences include the Visual Studio C++ Developer Experience team, the Direct3D HLSL Compiler team,
			the Windows Composition and Rendering team, and gameplay and tools programming in the videogame industry at Electronic Arts and Behavior.
			I have been programming since age ~10 and graduated in 2014 with a BSc in Computer Science with honours at McGill University.

		<h2>As a Musician</h2>
		<p>
			I've been a pianist for some 15 years, lately focusing on playing jazz standards and latin music in small ensembles.
			I also enjoy playing written music, where my repertoire has revolved around high quality video game music arrangements.

		<h2>As a Polyglot</h2>
		<p>
			I devote good parts of my free time to studying languages and attending language conversation groups.
			I am fluent in French, English and Spanish, and conversational in German, Portuguese and Italian.
		</p>
		<h2>As a Traveler</h2>
		<p>
			I enjoy nature through hiking, biking, camping and trekking.
			I discover the wider world through its people, their culture and their languages.
