# As a Software Engineer

I focus on tools and systems programming: graphics, shaders, GPGPU, security, compilers, file formats, object-oriented and API design. Modern C++ and C# are my go-to languages. My work experiences include the Visual Studio C++ Developer Experience team, the Direct3D HLSL Compiler team, the Windows Composition and Rendering team, and gameplay and tools programming in the videogame industry at Electronic Arts and Behavior. I have been programming since age 10 and graduated in 2014 with a BSc in Computer Science with honors at McGill University.

# As a Musician

I have played piano since middle school, with a repertoire of latin music, jazz standards, and video game music arrangements.

# As a Polyglot

I devote good parts of my free time to studying languages and attending language conversation groups. I am fluent in French, English and Spanish, and conversational in German, Portuguese and Italian.

# As a Traveler

I enjoy nature through hiking, biking, camping and trekking. I discover the wider world through its people, their culture and their languages.
